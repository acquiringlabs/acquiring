# QA subcodebase

Welcome to the QA (Quality Assurance) subcodebase.

None of this code is meant to reach production. Instead, it's left here for any developer who wishes to deal with
the library in a mainstream environment, check performance and idiomatic uses, and reproduce bugs.

The purpose of these apps is to reenact common use cases of the library (e-commerce, payment orchestration platforms,
etc). It is easier to just implement what popular tutorials out there have done to have a clear image of what other
developers might be doing, simulating potential antipatterns that emerge from casual, low experience use.

Remember that entry level programmers outnumber experts. Any library worth its salt must be something that doesn't become
too complex in their hands, as they gain experience.
